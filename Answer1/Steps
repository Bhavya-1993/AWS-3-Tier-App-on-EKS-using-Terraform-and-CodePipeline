Steps:
Setup EKS Cluster with Terraform:

Write Terraform code to define your EKS cluster, including node groups, IAM roles, networking configurations, etc.
Initialize Terraform and apply the configuration to create the EKS cluster.
Containerize Your Application:

Dockerize your application components (frontend, backend, database) and push the Docker images to a container registry like Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
Create Kubernetes Manifests:

Write Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for deploying your application components as pods, services, deployments, etc., in the EKS cluster.
Set Up CodePipeline:

Define a CodePipeline using AWS Console or AWS CLI. The pipeline will have stages for source, build, and deploy.
Connect your Git repository as the source stage.
For the build stage, use AWS CodeBuild to build your Docker images and push them to ECR.
For the deploy stage, use a custom action or AWS CodeDeploy to apply Kubernetes manifests to your EKS cluster.
Configure IAM Roles:

Create IAM roles with appropriate permissions for CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and EKS access.
Test the Pipeline:

Trigger the pipeline manually or configure it to trigger automatically on changes to your Git repository.
Ensure the pipeline executes successfully and deploys your application to the EKS cluster.
Monitoring and Logging:

Set up monitoring and logging for your EKS cluster and application using services like Amazon CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
Additional Considerations:
Networking: Ensure proper networking configuration for your EKS cluster, including VPC, subnets, security groups, etc.
Security: Implement security best practices for your EKS cluster, including RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), Pod Security Policies, etc.
Scaling: Configure autoscaling for your application components based on metrics like CPU utilization, memory usage, etc.
Backup and Recovery: Implement backup and recovery strategies for your EKS cluster data.
Cost Optimization: Optimize costs by right-sizing your EKS cluster, using spot instances for nodes, etc.
